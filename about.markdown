Hi, I’m Dávid, I'm addicted to data-driven solutions. This blog was created to share the projects I have been working on and my thoughts about the things I learn. If I’m not working or reading blogs/papers then I'm probably doing bouldering or caressing every dog on the street. I hope you find the posts useful or/and interesting, if you wanna share anything then feel free to drop me an e-mail.
